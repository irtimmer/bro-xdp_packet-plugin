# irtimmer::AF_XDP

This plugin provides native AF_XDP support for Zeek.

## Requirements

- Linux kernel 4.18+
- Linux kernel source files
- LLVM and CLang to compile eBPF
- Zeek source files
- libbpf (included in the linux kernel source tree)

## Quick start

Compile the plugin.

``
./configure --zeek-dist=BRO_SOURCE_PATH --with-kernel=KERNEL_SOURCE_PATH --with-bpf=LIBBPF_PATH --with-clang=CLANG_COMPILER_PATH --with-llc=LLVM_COMPILER_PATH
make
``

After installation of the plugin it can be used by using `af_xdp` as prefix for the interface name.

```
zeek -i af_xdp::eth0
```
